            The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated bird, with attributes of wild species such as the red and
            grey junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male
            bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
            female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).

            In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of
            cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most
            widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China
            were the largest producers of beef.
